As a highly skilled and motivated data engineer, I have a strong educational background, with experience in programming and creating ETL/ELT pipelines using GCP, making me well-suited to work in a variety of data-related roles. My background in electronic engineering gives me a unique perspective and understanding of hardware and software systems. Additionally, I am well-equipped to work in diverse environments as I have lived and adapted to different cultures across various countries.
