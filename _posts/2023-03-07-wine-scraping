This FastAPI app uses path finding algorithms to create and solve mazes while allowing for strict pathing and accounting for weighted cells.

This [`repository`](https://github.com/velajua/wine_scraping) contains the necessary files to daploy a containerized app using Docker which is able to create mazes using a modified version of the Breadth-First-Search algorithm, as well as solutions to the generated mazes using various path-finding algorithms which can be found below.
