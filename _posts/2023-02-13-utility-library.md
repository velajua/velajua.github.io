This repository contains a collection of useful functions in Python, including web scraping, API integrations and day-to-day code snippets.

These functions can be easily integrated into your projects to save time and effort. The repository is organized into various sections, each containing a description of the functions included, as well as the requirements for running each of the functions.

The requirements can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

Note that some of the functions are dependent on others, as such some *_utils.py* need to be in the same folder to properly work.
